# Your function takes two arguments:
#
# 1. current father's age (years)
# 2. current age of his son (years)
#
# Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

def twice_as_old(dad_years_old, son_years_old):
    twice_son = son_years_old * 2
    if twice_son > dad_years_old:
        return twice_son - dad_years_old
    if twice_son < dad_years_old:
        return dad_years_old - twice_son
    if twice_son == dad_years_old:
        return 0
